## Hello there!

I'm **Vitaly Wexler**, a guy who loves Apple devices â€” and, as I discovered one day, loves building apps for them too.

I began learning Swift in **June 2024**, and since then, Iâ€™ve successfully created **four real iOS applications**, each one more complex than the last. They reflect the technologies and architectural patterns Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

Feel free to browse, clone, and explore them!

## ðŸš€ What's next?

Iâ€™m currently learning **SwiftUI** and working on a new app for **offline freelancers**.  
The idea is to help users store, organize, and manage information about their work, deals, clients, and income â€” all in one place.

## ðŸ’¼ Looking for Opportunities

Iâ€™m eager to contribute to real-world iOS projects as a **junior developer**.  
If youâ€™re looking for someone passionate, persistent, and constantly learning â€” feel free to reach out.
